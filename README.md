# Bell Button Biodiversity Challenge
Module 14 Challenge

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity (http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) dataset, which catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Requirements
1. Use the D3 library to read in samples.json form the web.
2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
4. Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
   * Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page
6. Update all the plots when a new sample is selected. 
7. Deploy your app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages. 
8. Bonus: Create a gauge chart to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.
